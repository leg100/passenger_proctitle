Passenger app instance title plugin
============================

This is a simple plugin for Rails which changes a Passenger app instance's title to reflect what it's currently doing. You can then determine a given app instance's status using "ps". For example:

  passenger [/var/railsapp|1|358]: handling 127.0.0.1: HEAD /feed/calendar/global/91/6de4
                 |         | |     |        |          |
                 |         | |     |        |          The current request (method and path)
                 |         | |     |        |
                 |         | |     |        The client IP
                 |         | |     |
                 |         | |     What it's doing
                 |         | |     
                 |         | The number of requests processed during the server's lifetime
                 |         |
                 |         The number of requests currently queued/being processed concurrently (FIXME: always '1')
                 |
                 The app directory that passenger is serving


Installing into a Rails Passenger app
-----------------------------------

Nothing special. Just drop the plugin in vendor/plugins.


Installing into a non-Rails Passenger app
---------------------------------------

Just require the module during startup:

  require "passenger_proctitle"

(Probably won't work ;-)
